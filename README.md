In this project i go through a detailed exploratoty data analysis using both SQL queries and Tableau dashboarding tools. I tried to generate useful information through asking questions about key aspects of the business which can help us achieve a clearer picture of what the Parch & Posey database tells us.

The database tracks the sales of a fictional Business called 'Parch & Posey' which sells different types of paper to multiple clients across the United States.

The Data Model consists of 5 tables:
* accounts
* orders
* web_events
* sales_rep
* region

Using Tableau's Data processing feature, i tried to join all the data into a single table which highlights all details of every order in the database for each account.
### Data Model:
